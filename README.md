üëã **Hi!** I am a 24 years old full-stack software engineer, based in Romania.

My programming journey started in 2013 with Java, when I started writing mods for the popular survival game, Minecraft.  

Later, in 2014 I participated in the Cicada 3301 online puzzle, which got me hooked on cryptography.  

I've considered myself a privacy advocate since. In my free time I like to prototype privacy-oriented, decentralized solutions, such as the privy peer-to-peer chat application built on IPFS and OrbitDB.  

### Work

I currently work at [@minyma technologies](https://www.minyma-tech.com/) as a backend/blockchain engineer since 2022. I design smart contracts in Solidity for the [@galaxis](https://galaxis.xyz/#/) community space. I am a part of the backend team behind [@quino.ai](quino.ai)

### Education

üéì I graduated from TU-CN, with a bachelor's degree as software engineer, in 2022.
