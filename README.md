> 23 years old software engineer based in Romania, with a keen interest in decentralizing all the things. As an open source enthusiast and privacy advocate, I believe in making knowledge available to all for free and simultaneously taking back one's rights to their private data to one's self only. Also I like basketball and hiking.
