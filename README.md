üëã **Hi!** I am a 25 years old full-stack software engineer, based in Romania.

My programming journey started in 2013 with Java, when I started writing mods for the popular survival game, Minecraft.  

Later, in 2014 I participated in the Cicada 3301 online puzzle, which got me hooked on cryptography.  

I've considered myself a privacy advocate since. In my free time I like to prototype privacy-oriented, decentralized solutions, such as the privy peer-to-peer chat application built on IPFS and OrbitDB.  

### Work
- Currently working at [webgurus.io](https://webgurus.io) as a full stack engineer and tech lead on multiple projects.
- Before that I worked at [@minyma technologies](https://www.minyma-tech.com/) as a backend/frontend/blockchain engineer. I designed smart contracts in Solidity for the [@galaxis](https://galaxis.xyz/#/) community space. I was a part of the engineering team behind [@quino.ai](https://quino.ai)

### Education

üéì I graduated from TU-CN, with a bachelor's degree as software engineer, in 2022.
